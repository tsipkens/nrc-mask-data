# SD22

This data contains a comparison of particle filtration efficiency (PFE) measured using (1) a neutralized, polydisperse NaCl and (2) an unneutralized, monodisperse PSL challenge aerosols. 

Two data files are included: 

1. **data.json**: A full dataset, including individual samples and pressure data, in JSON format. 

2. **data_ave.csv**: Lot-averaged PFE data in CSV format.

We have also included code in Python, Javascript (via Node.js), and Matlab to read in the JSON file into a native format for each language.
