A repository containing measurements of masks, respirators, and filtration media. Measurements include pressure drop and particle filtration efficiency (PFE), with accompanying methods for computing number-based filtration efficiencies (NPFE) and mass-based filtration efficiency (MPFE). 

### Notes

- Filtration is given as a penetration, *P*, and as a fraction (not a percentage). Thus, PFEs in percent are given by 100%(1 - *P*).

- Penetrations reported for the TSI1 and TSI2 have a single value across repeats of the same lot. This is the mean for internal measurements that were matched based on the lot. 

- The most penetrating particle size (MPPS) was determined probabilistically, as per the support manuscript.
